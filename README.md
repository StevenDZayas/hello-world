# hello-world
A recap of hello world, because I haven't done this in a few months and I forgot...
Okay! Really hoping this works out. I didn't do this before, in the OdinProject, but I think we did something similar, just in VS code, or something like that. 
This way, I can review what I've done (the lack of a command line and code helps, I think, because it encourages me to review the overarching material, without getting bogged down by distracting code). Once I do this, I can see how long until I can get back to where I left off a few months ago.
